This will be a program that will run on my Raspberry Pi in my car.

Goals:
    OBD2 real time data viewing on character LCD screen
        - continuously poll for data from the OBD2 port via an ELM327 based interface
        - keep the data points currently on the screen at ~1s freshness
    MP3 player with character LCD screen interface
        - flip through multiple folders in a single directory and play music out of them
    OBD2 mode 1 data logging
        - log the data from the OBD2 port every 15s or so

I realize that others have done different versions of this before me. That's ok. 
This is my Carputer. There are many like it, but this one is mine...
