This will be a program that will run on my Raspberry Pi in my car.


Project Goals:

1) OBD2 real time data viewing on character LCD screen

- continuously poll for data from the OBD2 port via an ELM327 based interface

- keep the data points currently on the screen at ~1s freshness

2) MP3 player with character LCD screen interface

- flip through multiple folders in a single directory and play music out of them

3) OBD2 mode 1 data logging

- log the data from the OBD2 port every 15s or so


Life Goals:

1) learn some C and C++ whilst building a cool project

2) conquer world, etc.


I realize that others have done different versions of this before me. That's ok. 
This is my Carputer. There are many like it, but this one is mine...
