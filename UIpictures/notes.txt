These are a couple of pictures of my user interface. 

You can see an example of the drawers in the main Music screen - you can go 
down in a drawer by using the left and right buttons to move the cursor to 
the ">" for the drawer and pressing the select button.

The song list screen and now playing screens have some blurry-looking text on
them - that's because that text is scrolling.
